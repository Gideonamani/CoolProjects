Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Fill in your answer here
    Because sometimes I might have made some changes to my files that I don't
    want yet to be publically available and thus the manual control of when
    to pull and push files and folders is quite important.

    from a remote repository
    Braches are heads other that the main one.
